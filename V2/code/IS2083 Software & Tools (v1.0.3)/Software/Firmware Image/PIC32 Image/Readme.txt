Depending on MCLK selection on Configuration tools files, 
there are two files to let user to choose:

1) PIC32_BM83_EVB_STCodec_MCLK_128Fs_v1.6.3_EVB_2_0.hex
THis PIC32 hex file support MCLK 128fs on EVB2.0.


2)PIC32_BM83_EVB_STCodec_MCLK_256Fs_v1.6.3_EVB_2_0.hex
This PIC32 hex file support MCLK 256fs on EVB2.0
